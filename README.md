# Devuan i3wm rice by hand7s!

This is my third rice. But first dotfiles with repo.

## Main pkgs;

As I use Debian-based we'll go with `apt`:

```bash
apt install i3 picom feh zsh rofi neofetch st polybar flameshot btop xinit
```

P.S.
Optianally, you can install Display Manager. 

## Howto:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s0me1newithhand7s/Devuanrice
cd devuanrice
cp -r devuanrice ~/.config/
cd ..
rm -rf devuanrice
``` 

~(Do not forget tp delete it after use!)~

### Friendly reminder:
I use terminus TTF, so be careful - change `font` in configs, if haven't one.

## TL:DR
**I'm not an anti-systemd nor anti-RedHat team. This whole rice more likly ny skilltest, not an actual system. However, you can use it as good as I on systemd / alt. init systemd, bc there is no init-depend software.
**Also, **I've used `amuse` OMZ theme.** There is rumors that OMZ is bad, pay attention on it. Don't be like me. 
Last, but not least - **there is no VIM layout in i3wm**. Bc I can't use VIM and dc it layout. Blame me, if yyou want.
